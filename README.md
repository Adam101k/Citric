# Citric Introduction
Citric is an image editing software developed over the semester as a part of the Spring 2024 CPSC 362-19 class. Citric is an image editing application akin to photoshop gimp and, in particular, MS Paint. The design prioritizes simplicity, convenience, and the ability to complete uncomplicated projects quickly. The Application allows for the importation of image files into projects where edits can be made to filter systems that enable users to make complex changes to the photo based on a set of predetermined options.
